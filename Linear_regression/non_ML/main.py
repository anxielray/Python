# [Question 1]: Implementing a Linear Regression Model from Scratch

# Objective: Develop a simple linear regression model without using machine learning libraries. This exercise will enhance your understanding of fundamental AI algorithms and mathematical modeling.

#Tasks:

#    Generate Synthetic Data: Create a dataset with a linear relationship between variables xx and yy, adding some random noise.
#    Compute Parameters: Calculate the slope (m) and intercept (b) of the best-fit line using the least squares method.
#    Prediction Function: Implement a function that predicts yy values for given xx inputs based on the computed parameters.
#    Visualization: Plot the original data points and the fitted line to visualize the regression.

# Benefits: This exercise reinforces concepts in linear algebra and statistics, foundational to many AI algorithms.

# [Question 2]: Exercise 1: Linear Regression from Scratch

# Objective: Implement a simple linear regression model from scratch to predict outcomes based on input features.

# Instructions:

#     Generate a synthetic dataset with a linear relationship between the input feature xxx and output yyy. You can use a formula like y=2x+1+noisey = 2x + 1 + \text{noise}y=2x+1+noise, where "noise" can be randomly generated using NumPy.
#     Implement the linear regression algorithm using the least squares method. Calculate the slope mmm and intercept bbb based on the normal equation.
#     Create a function to predict yyy values using the determined slope and intercept for new xxx inputs.
#     Plot the original data points along with the regression line.

# Hints:

#     Use Python libraries like numpy and matplotlib for calculations and plotting.
#     Remember to include a way to visualize your results.
