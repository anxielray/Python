#[Question 1]: Exercise 1: Implementing a Linear Regression Model from Scratch

#Objective: Develop a simple linear regression model without using machine learning libraries. This exercise will enhance your understanding of fundamental AI algorithms and mathematical modeling.

#Tasks:

#    Generate Synthetic Data: Create a dataset with a linear relationship between variables xx and yy, adding some random noise.
#    Compute Parameters: Calculate the slope (m) and intercept (b) of the best-fit line using the least squares method.
#    Prediction Function: Implement a function that predicts yy values for given xx inputs based on the computed parameters.
#    Visualization: Plot the original data points and the fitted line to visualize the regression.

#Benefits: This exercise reinforces concepts in linear algebra and statistics, foundational to many AI algorithms.
