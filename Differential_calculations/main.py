#[Question 2]: Exercise 2: Solving Differential Equations Numerically

#Objective: Use Python to approximate solutions to ordinary differential equations (ODEs), a common task in mathematical modeling and simulations.

#Tasks:

#    Select an ODE: Choose a first-order ODE, such as the exponential growth equation dydt=kydtdyâ€‹=ky.
#    Implement Euler's Method: Write a function to approximate the solution over a specified interval using Euler's method.
#    Compare Solutions: Compare your numerical solution to the analytical solution to assess accuracy.
#    Visualization: Plot both the numerical and analytical solutions for comparison.

# Benefits: This task enhances your ability to apply numerical methods to solve mathematical problems, a valuable skill in both AI and applied mathematics.
